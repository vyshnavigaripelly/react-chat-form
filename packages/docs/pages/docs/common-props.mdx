# Common Props

Every input element (Input, Select, MultiSelect) in this library has a bunch of common props with same functionality. They're listed in this page to avoid redundancy.

## name

| Type              | Default | Description                                              |
| ----------------- | :-----: | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| string (required) |    -    | The name corresponding to the input for the form's state |

The name corresponding to the input (the answer to the question asked) in the formState. Every input element **must** have different names.

## pretext

| Type                | Default | Description                                               |
| ------------------- | :-----: | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| string or ReactNode |    -    | Text or ReactNode for information preceding the question. |

The **pretext** prop takes a string or a react node which is rendered right before the question block. This can be used to provide context about the question you're about to ask or serve as a reply for the previous answer.
This is an option al prop and can accept both string and ReactNode.

```.jsx
<ChattyForm disableAutoScroll>
  <Input
    name="name"
    pretext="I'm gonna ask you your name. Be prepared."
    question="Howdy! What's your name?"
    placeholder="Type your answer"
  />
  <Select
    name="pet"
    pretext="You have an awesome name."
    question="Do you like dogs more or cats?"
    options={[
      { label: 'Dogs', value: 'dogs' },
      { label: 'Cats', value: 'cats' },
    ]}
  />
</ChattyForm>
```

## question

| Type                           | Default | Description                                         |
| ------------------------------ | :-----: | --------------------------------------------------- |
| string or ReactNode (required) |    -    | The text or ReactNode for the question to be asked. |

This is a mandatory prop. It contains the text for the question to be asked to the end user. Also accepts ReactNode.

## renderAnswer

| Type                                        | Default | Description                            |
| ------------------------------------------- | :-----: | -------------------------------------- |
| Function: (answer) => string \|\| reactNode |    -    | The text for the question to be asked. |

When a answer is entered/selected by the end user, the answer block displays the same selected answer(s) by default. We can override this behavoir using the **renderAnswer** prop.

The **renderAnswer** takes recieves the user entered answer as an argument. Whatever is returned by **renderAnswer** prop is rendered in the Answer Block. Example Below.

```.jsx
<ChattyForm disableAutoScroll>
  <Input
    name="age"
    question="What's your age?"
    type="number"
    renderAnswer={(age) => (age < 18 ? 'Kiddo Age' : 'Gotta pay taxes age')}
  />
</ChattyForm>
```

## finaltext

| Type                | Default | Description                                         |
| ------------------- | :-----: | --------------------------------------------------- |
| string or ReactNode |    -    | Text or ReactNode as a reply for the final question |

Since there are no questions succeeding the final answer is entered, this is a way to give the user one final message prompt.

```.jsx
<ChattyForm disableAutoScroll>
  <Input
    name="age"
    question="What's your name?"
    finaltext="Thanks for playing"
  />
</ChattyForm>
```
