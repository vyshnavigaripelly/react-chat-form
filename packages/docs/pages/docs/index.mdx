# Getting Started

Install chatty-form and it's peer dependency in your project from npm or yarn

```sh
npm install chatty-form framer-motion

# or

yarn add chatty-form framer-motion
```

This package contains only 4 components. A parent **ChattyForm** component and three input components **Input, Select & MultiSelect** which interact with the user.
Wrap any of the input component in **`<Chattyform/>`** to get started. Let's write the basic amount of code to get it up and running.

```jsx
import { ChattyForm, Input } from 'chatty-form';
```

```.jsx
<ChattyForm>
  <Input
    name="name"
    question="Howdy! What's your name?"
    placeholder="Type your answer"
  />
</ChattyForm>
```

There you go! We are now successfully using chatty-form.

According the the library semantics and the naming used internally, each chat block of UI which captures the user's input contains a question block, an InputSection and the answer block.

The flow of the UI is as follows.

1. A question is presented to the user. (A question can have a pretext which is just another message block preceeding the question block).
2. User selects from the options or inputs appropriate response.
3. The answer selected by the user is presented in an answer block. By default it just displays the answer(s) selected/entered back to the user but this can be customized to render anything.
