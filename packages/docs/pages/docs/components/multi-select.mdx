# MultiSelect

The **MultiSelect** component gives the user user a way to choose multiple(or none) options as an answer to a question.

```.jsx
<ChattyForm>
  <MultiSelect
    name="multi"
    question="Which of these are fruits?"
    options={[
      { label: 'Pumpkins', value: 'pumpkins' },
      { label: 'Peppers', value: 'peppers' },
      { label: 'Cucumber', value: 'cucumber' },
      { label: 'Tomato  ', value: 'tomato' },
      { label: 'Peas  ', value: 'peas' },
    ]}
  />
</ChattyForm>
```

Upon submission the formState gets assigned array of selected objects from the options w.r.t it's name prop. (Or an empty array if none of these are selected)

```js
// formState

{
  multi: [
    { label: 'Pumpkins', value: 'pumpkins' },
    { label: 'Peppers', value: 'peppers' },
  ];
}
```

## Props

In addition to the [Common Props](/docs/common-props) which are found in every data input element (Input, Select and MultiSelect) here are the props the **MultiSelect** component accepts.

### options

| Type                                                                       | Description                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| [{label: string, value: string}] <br/> (Array of Object of the given type) | Array of options for user to choose from |

This is a required prop. The **option** prop accepts an array of Object of the following type

```js
{label: string, value: string}
```

The Label contains the text to be shown to the user inside a button as an option. Sometimes the displayed label text isn't useful to work with, hence an alternate value is also provided.
