import SelectPetExample from '../../../src/examples/select-pet';

# Select

The select component gives the user user a way to choose one out of multiple options as an answer to a question.

<SelectPetExample />

Upon submition the formState gets assigned the selected objects from the options w.r.t it's name prop

```js
// formState

{ pet: {label: 'Cat', value: 'cat'}}

```

## Props

In addition to the [Common Props](/docs/common-props) which are found in every data input element (Input, Select and MultiSelect) here are the props the **Select** component accepts.

### options

| Type                                                                       | Description                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| [{label: string, value: string}] <br/> (Array of Object of the given type) | Array of options for user to choose from |

This is a required prop. The **option** prop accepts an array of Object of the following type

```js
{label: string, value: string}
```

The Label contains the text to be shown to the user inside a button as an option. Sometimes the displayed label text isn't useful to work with, hence an alternate value is also provided.
